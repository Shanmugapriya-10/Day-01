1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2?

HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol, and it is the basic for all web application.

The first usable version of HTTP created in 1997. Because it went through several stages of development, this first
version of HTTP was called HTTTP/1.1.

HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other
resources behind it.

In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created.

HTTP/2 is much faster and efficient than HTTP/1.1.

HTTP/2 uses a single TCP connection to sends multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks
any other resources.
